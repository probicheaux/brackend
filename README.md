install `docker` and `docker-compose`

try `docker-compose up` in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`, and then in another tab or process `curl localhost:8000/api/hello/`

you should get a token back, which shows you have the api up locally

make sure to do `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose build` when you're making changes
